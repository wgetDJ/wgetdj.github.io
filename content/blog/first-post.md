# Welcome to My Blog

This is my **first blog post** on my new personal website. I built this site using Next.js and it automatically generates pages from markdown files.

## Features

- Automatic date generation
- Syntax highlighting
- Responsive design
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Code Example

Here's some JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Images

You can also include images in your posts by placing them in the `public` folder and referencing them like this:

![Example](path/to/image.jpg)

That's all for now. More posts coming soon!
