name: "Hello!"
bio: |
  I'm a Senior Software Developer at [Arcadis Gen](https://www.arcadisgen.com/), currently working on the [Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)](https://www.arcadisgen.com/en/products/enterprise-asset-management) platform. My focus is on building scalable, resilient systems deeply integrated with [IBM Maximo](https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo) and other enterprise solutions.

  I've led multiple teams, built products from the ground up, and contributed to internal working groups to standardize the tech stack and development tools across the company.

  Previously, I contributed to [CurbIQ](https://www.curbiq.io/), where I scaled geospatial platforms and enhanced map-driven data experiences. Over the years, I've been part of high-impact projects spanning infrastructure, mobility, and sustainability.

  What I Do:
  - Build and scale full-stack enterprise applications
  - Integrate and extend systems with [IBM Maximo](https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo)
  - Engineer platforms that handle complex geospatial and operational data
